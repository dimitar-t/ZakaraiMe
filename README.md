“ZakaraiMe” is a web application in the IT sphere, which is extremely useful in our day-to-day life because it connects people, who offer transportation with people, who are looking for such throughout the country both in and outside the city. This helps reduce the dangerous and toxic emissions which pollute the air and also eases the congestion in the big cities and on the highways. The design and the way the application works are very intuitive, which gets the users excited about it and wanting to use it again. This is especially important for realizing the goals upon which the idea of shared travel is built.
